Hello! I'm Heet Nagoriya,

As an Information Technology student, I’m deeply driven by the power of technology to innovate and simplify the world around us. From coding and software development to experimenting with emerging technologies, I thrive on exploring new possibilities. Every line of code is a chance to create something impactful—whether it’s a solution to a tricky problem or a new open-source project to help others.

I'm constantly learning, constantly building, and always excited to collaborate on projects that push the boundaries of what’s possible.
